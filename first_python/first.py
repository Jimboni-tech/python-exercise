while True:

    try:
        num = input('what is your favorite number? ')
        square = int(num)**2
        print('The square of', num, 'is', square)
        break
    except:
        print('Please enter a valid number')

I learned how to use a while True loop in order to continously repeat until a certain statement was found, in this case, a number. I then learned how to use break to stop a loop.
I also learned how to use try and except.
